### What I learned

Here I learned how to make responsive svg and implement my learning.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div className='order-page__hero-image-container'>
            <Hero className='order-page__hero-image' viewBox='0 0 450 220' />
</div>
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue use SCSS and its resusable variable and make more projects with react and scss to make it more compfortable for me.
